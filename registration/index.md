      Dear friends in ASIAN workshop community, <br><br>
Asian Workshop on First-Principles Electronic Structure Calculations has kept "no registration fee policy" till ASIAN-25. However, recent (economic) circumstance makes collection of sufficient financial support by the local organizing committee (LOC) quite burden. Therefore, ASIAN-26 LOC has discussed with ASIAN workshop International Organizing Committee and confirmed that the "no registration policy" can be changed depending on the financial situation. <br><br>
We promise we would do our best to keep the policy. However, we hope our friends kindly understand this situation and accept the application of finite registration fee to Non-student participants if necessary. We'll note that we keep "no registration fee" for the students.<br><br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Yoshitaka Tateyama, on behalf of ASIAN-26 LOC

### VISA

Japan is currently implementing a visa exemption policy for citizens of 71 countries and regions. Please refer to [this page](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) for the list of visa exempt countries and regions. Participants from these countries can enter Japan without a visa. However, participants from other countries are required to obtain a visa before entering Japan.

If you need a visa to enter Japan, please apply for it at the Japanese embassy or consulate in your country. The LOC will accept requests for invitation letters **after the registration opens.** More details will be provided at that time.
